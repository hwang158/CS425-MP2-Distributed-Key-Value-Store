- The project building is powered by [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/). If it is at your hand, you can simply run the following command at the root of the project:

    ```bash
    $ ant
    ```

 This will generate a directory named `dist/`. The complied and packed `.jar` package is inside.

- Move to `dist/`, and Run the **cs425-mp2.jar** with specified vertual machine id (01/02/../10).

    ```bash
    $ java -jar cs425-mp2.jar [VM ID]
    ```

    for example:

    ```bash
    $ java -jar cs425-mp2.jar 01
    ```
